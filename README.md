# What has been done
 
QT 6 has been used to create a simple notepad application performing basic tasks like cut , copy , paste on text.
Other things include changing the font,underline, bold and italics the selected text
Also we can create new text files ,save this text file and open an existing file

# Issues/Challenges
QT6 currently has very less resources available , also I not being much proficient in C++ took lots of time first to revise my CPP concepts
and later had to research on various resources to learn QT. For a first timer like me , QT had a very steep learning curve
